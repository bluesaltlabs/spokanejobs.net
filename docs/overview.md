# Overview

Bedrock Frontend.


## About

Bedrock is a job search tool. The SpokaneJobs.Net website is a directory of local companies and a list of jobs scraped from local job boards.
Included with this tool are resources for job seekers to store their job search information locally.
This application is in active development, and feature specifics are still in the process of being defined. Stay tuned for more information.

Bedrock is inspired by the first project I worked on professionally - Foundations. This system provided Spokane Public Schools students
with tools to track their learning portfolio, volunteer experience, and other job-related information, as well as search for
resources and work opportunities.

This section needs more information.


## Companies

> [SpokaneJobs.Net/companies](https://spokanejobs.net/companies)

The companies listed on the site are manually curated by the site administrator.
If a company is missing and should be added, or if a company would like to be removed from this directory,
please contact the site administrator via one of the channels on the [contact](https://spokanejobs.net/contact) page.



## Jobs

> [SpokaneJobs.Net/jobs](https://spokanejobs.net/jobs)

Lists jobs retrieved from local job boards. This page allows the user to search for jobs and view the associated details.
This page is still a work in progress.



## Profile

> [SpokaneJobs.Net/profile](https://spokanejobs.net/profile)

The user profile page allows job seekers to store information pertaining to their job search and resume locally.
This data is not transmitted, but can be imported and exported. In the future, external services for saving data
(i.e. cloud services or a git repository) will likely be used to back up this data. Additionally, tools for generating a
resume from a template and other tools are planned.
