    <h1>About | Bedrock</h1>

    <p>
      In 2013 I was hired with Spokane Public Schools as an intern with the
      Career and Technical Education Department. I had a variety of tasks, but
      one of my primary duties was to work on an application called Foundations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of Foundations was to enable students to save their
      work, volunteer, and other accomplishment information during the course of their
      high school career. This was a project started by another intern about a
      year prior, and he had since been hired on permenently to work on other projects.
      (I should credit him and write his name, because he did a lot of work.)
    </p>

    <p>
      This application was written in C# .NET with jQuery front end components.
      The version control system was SVN, and it was my first experience with
      TortoiseSVN and these technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      In any case, that application never really reached its full potential, and
      I too moved on to larger projects within a few months. This was over 12 years
      ago, and this Bedrock project is partly inspired by some of the core concepts
      first established within Foundations.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project powers the SpokaneJobs.net website, which will soon be deployed
      and will scrape local company job board sites for job postings on a regular basis.
      This data will be currated at SpokaneJobs.net and eventually allow users to
      view information about local companies, jobs, organizations, events, meetup groups,
      and other information and resources related to employment in the Spokane region.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, this project intends to allow users to eventually set up a profile
      with historical information about their education, employment history, volunteering
      experiences, accomplishments and achievements, skills, and any other job-relevant
      information to equip the local workforce for the local labor market to the best of our ability.
