# Ifrastructure as code

- write Supabase migrations.
- [ ] see notes in outlier playground message about migrations for :
  - enums, tables, pivot tables, indexes, timestamp triggers, and row level security
- [ ] the migrations should be dated instead of added the way I'm doing it.
  - they need to be run in a specific order.
