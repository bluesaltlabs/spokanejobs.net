# Scraper

todo: write Go / Colly scraper app.


## Developing

run locally from the root of the project with:

```bash
# from the `bedrock/scraper/` directory, run
go run ./cmd
```

---

## To Do

- [ ] set up a portion of this script to dump data to the associated github repo.
- [ ] set up a portion of this app to connect to supabase and upsert values into the database.
- [ ] This will need to use an SDK, so figure out how to get that set up and connected.
